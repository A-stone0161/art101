					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we learned how to use anonymous functions and callbacks so we can execute functions asynchronously and singularly in our code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Getting the functions to return the results is still confusing to me. I don't think I'm using the correct syntax to call the anonymous functions and get the results to output. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This is definitely one of the more complex tools we've learned and it's taking me awhile to wrap my head around it. This is probably going to be a practice makes muscle memory situation. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The result of this lab is the output from multiple variables being applied to a number array using anonymous functions, .map and callbacks. </p>
