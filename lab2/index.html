					<h2><strong>Summary of Efforts</strong></h2>
					<p><i>We worked together over zoom and text for this lab to accommodate health and schedules. We felt like we had a good grasp of the HTML, but found the CSS less intuitive. We understood the 'rules' of CSS and were able to complete the expected lab elements using it. It was cool to stylize our websites beyond just plain text! Overall it was great to experience working with a more legitimate coding language.</i></p>
