					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I ended up struggling with the function to actually sort the user's input value to assign a magic type, so I went to W3Schools to find a different solution, and used a DOM modification function instead. Still don;t fully understand how that works compared to other jQuery functions. </p>

					<p> I had a fun time with this lab, it was a cool prompt and used a skill (conditionals) I find deeply useful. </p>

			<h2>Welcome to the world of Skullduggery Pleasant</h2>
			<p>There are four base kinds of magic users, each with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses. When a sorcerer comes of age, their type of magic is solidified as they go through the surge. Your time has come, which discipline will be yours?<p>
