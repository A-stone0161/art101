					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we learned to use, call and define functions in our JS code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I still find functions and the syntax surrounding them <i>incredibly</i> confusing, but as someone who learns by doing, this lab has helped a lot.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>When I got stuck on this lab, I learned how to use substack to find solutions other people had presented. It was a great new tool to gain access to, and it gave me a great deal more confidence in my ability to problem solve while coding. Coming to this class with absolutely zero experience coding I've had some moments of stress, but the reassurance that there are whole communities of support and help out there changed my perspective. This lab really drove home the point about collaboration in coding that Wes has made repeatedly in class.</p>
