					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Getting the loop to output correctly was an absoluet struggle for me. We were printing to the console when we worked on this in class so I had to figure out how to get the results to print in the div output (I did forget to call the function, despite the reminder... oops). </p>

					<p> I had a fun time with this lab, it was a cool prompt and it built off of the past few labs which felt incredibly satisfying. </p>
